# RAG Financial Document Analysis üìà

This project is a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to ask questions about dense financial documents (like a 10-K annual report) and receive accurate, context-aware answers.

The application is built with a modern Python stack and integrates a powerful API-based Large Language Model (Google Gemini). It also includes a complete MLOps evaluation pipeline using MLflow and a CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions for automated testing.
